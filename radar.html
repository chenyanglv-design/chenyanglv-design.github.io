                    In my online shopping experience, I always find that choosing between a large number of products(on Amazon, for example) can be physically exhausting. 
                    And when I want to buy something really expensive and high-tech, I want to ask experts for advice.

                    I also conducted some interviews with my friends and classmates and I realized that many UM students are facing the same problems and they are not able to find efficient solutions.

                    I designed a survey with 11 key questions and received 30+ responses from my friends and classmates who have online shopping experiences. More than 8 of them had 2+ times of online shopping within the past 2 weeks. After the survey, I interviewed 5 of them to dive deeper into their needs and pain points.     
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    About 57% of respondents said that they always feel overwhelmed when shopping something new when there are too many options and more than 90% of respondents said they want to ask experts for professional advice when it comes to purchases of high-tech and professional stuff like electronics and drugs.

                <p> To test and evaluate my design, I created a paper prototype. After usability testings with 4 target users, I started to generate insights into how to improve my solutions.</p>

                    I found 3 main pain points from usability testings and made adjustments that correspond to these pain points.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. The browser plugin is not the best way to carry out the chatbot function, because users would have too many options to focus on the chatbot while looking at the online shopping website. 
                    <br>            
                    2. The layout of the comparison function must be more direct, easy-to-understand and even modifiable.
                    <br>              
                    3. The survey in the onboarding process should not be required, some users chose to ignore the function because it is confusing and costs too much time.

                    During the design of this application, I kept putting myself in the position of a user. I was trying to think in the way of the user who is confused about what she or he should buy when facing many options. For example, in the beginning, I was not sure about whether it should be a mobile application or a website or a plugin for a mobile application or a plugin for a browser. So I had four choices. Then I asked my friends and got their opinions. I found out most of the users would find they need a shopping assistant while they are browsing the shopping platform. No one would think that they need to ask a chatbot for help before they get confused by millions of products. So I decided to make it a plugin for a web browser, which makes it easily accessible. Users can just open the extension when they are browsing the shopping website instead of jumping around different pages or taking their cell phones out of their pockets. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a consumer who suffers a lot when choosing items online, I want to save peopleâ€™s time and effort in buying things online. Also, it can be a waste of money when people choose some expensive devices that they donâ€™t need, which is very frustrating. During my talking with my target users, I found that many of them are interested in learning some basic knowledge of electronics, but they just donâ€™t know how to start. So I hope this application can also be a good learning tool for people to start to know more and more of the electronic products.

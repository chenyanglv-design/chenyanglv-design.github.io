                    From March 2017 to August 2018, I worked at Whale Design as a product designer. Whale Design, which launched in 2017, takes companies' design requests and floats competitions for freelance designers, with the winner being allowed on work on the company's project and earning a bonus as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the individual product/UX designer on this project, I was mainly responsible for the design of the second iteration of the website product. After the one-month user and market research, I decided to incorporate the gamification strategy into our product to optimize the design contest process and improve user experience.

                                Contestants who are not winners would also earn XP as prizes which can help them level up their accounts. We incorporated the XP Grading System into our product mainly for two reasons:

                                1. We want to encourage all users to participate in contests and help them improve their skills.

                                2. We would be able to rank designers on our platform based on their account levels.

                <p>
                    To quickly get familiar with the current website, I began my research by creating an interaction map of the current website and a contest flow diagram. I noticed there are two issues: 
                </p>

                <p>
                    </br>
                    1. Averagely, one contest would have 150 submissions, but only 10% of them can earn prizes and others just get nothing. This contest mode can be a huge disappointment to those designers who work hard but get nothing
                    </br>
                    2. Other than uploading designs and waiting for results, there is nothing else designers can do on the platform. There is potential to create new features for them.

                    After previous research, 
                    I conducted 4 interviews with current users to understand their goals/pain points in their work as well as their experience on the website.
                    From interviews, I realized that the money is not always the motivation for designers to participate contests. Designers at different levels can have different goals.

                <p>
                    An interesting detail that I noticed during interviews is that one designer said he has won 5 contests. But I know that 
                    we only have 21 contests on the platform at that time and 5 of them are still ongoing, which means he won 1/3 of all the contests.

                    <br>
                    This finding drew my attention, which made me want to explore the data about our designers, I had three questions in mind:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    01. How many active designers do we have on the platform? 
                    <br>
                    02. What percent of designers have earned money from contests? 
                    <br>
                    03. Designers stop participating in contests after how many times of failures?

                    After creating personas, I have a solid understanding of what needs do designers at different levels have. I want to
                    create a new mechanism to help different types of users achieve their goals and also participate in more contests.

                   We brainstormed more than 10 ideas and sketched them out. We presented our findings and designs to the development team and product manager to get feedback.

                <p>
                    I decided to incorporate the gamification strategy into our product after brainstorming. I found game players and Whale Design
                    users have many things in common, especially they both care about improving their skills in the game or design and players or users with
                    skills at different levels would perform differently on the same task/contest. After two-week gamification research, I came up with four insights of how should I implement this strategy:

                    It is intimidating to step into a whole new world like the real estate industry and try to fix problems for experts in that area.
                    I did spend a fair amount of time on understanding how does the real estate transaction work in the U.S., who are the stakeholders, and even real estate terms.
                    But those efforts paid off when I started to work on the design part. I can put myself in users' shoes and be confident about my ideas because I know every single step in the 
                    whole complicated progress and when I took a closer look at each of them, the perplexing process will be broken down into multiple smaller pieces and the problem is easier to solve.

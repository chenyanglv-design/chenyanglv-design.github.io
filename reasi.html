                    How does the current system help users complete their tasks and is there any usability issue?
                </span>
                <p> 
                    I conducted a user flow analysis of the current Reasi website by creating an interaction map, and at the same time, I
                    also reviewed each of the interfaces and compared it against accepted usability principles by using heuristic evaluations.
                    My goals are trying to quickly get a solid understanding of Reasi product and see where things could potentially be improved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key Findings:
                    </br>1. The user flow can be divided into three parts: Onboarding process, Create a listing & share, and workspace.
                    </br>2. The onboarding process seems too long and also confusing.
                    </br>3. Create a listing process also seems overwhelming.
                    </br>4. The workspace requires users to complete many tasks but lacks guidance.
                    </br>5. Dashboard needs more indicators(colors, pictures, icons) to show different roles and status.

                <p>
                    The interaction map made me realize that the workspace is the most important feature of Reasi which digitizes
                    the transaction between land buyers and sellers and also secures the entire process. I decided to do some interviews with
                    Reasi employees and current users to figure out their pain points and also what are the steps that they need to go over to complete the real estate transaction.

                <p>
                   As the transaction process consists of multiple steps and stakeholders, it is complicated and fragmented. I decided to map all of the 
                   steps and create a transaction workflow diagram which helped us get a better understanding of users' tasks in the process and 
                   how might we improve the workspace feature to help me complete tasks more efficiently.

                <p>After previous research, I presented my findings to my ZLI manager and the product manager of Reasi. 
                    We ran a brainstorming session to come up with new solution ideas, then we used the Impact/Effort matrix to evaluate our ideas.<p>

                <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>OVERVIEW</b> 
                </br>The whole design process includes three iterations. I started from the original version of the dashboard. Since previous research told us that Reasi users who are land investors play both the seller and the buyer role at the same time, I kept the original design that users can check lands they are selling and buying on the same page. But I adopted many strategies here to help users distinguish each listing and manage listings effectively, which include changing the layout of the card, adding property photos, and also using orange color to represent the role of buyer, and light blue color to represent the role of the seller.
                </br> For each iteration, I presented my design to ZLI manager and Reasi product manager to get feedback and for the 2nd and 3rd round of iteration, we conducted usability testing to get feedback from users.

                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 1:</b> 
                    </br>To start with, I took a look at the information architecture of the card and 
                    see if the hierarchy that the card is surfacing to users is what they need to see the most.
                    And also I wanted to know if the listing card is providing enough or digestible amount of information to the user.
                <p>
                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/original-IA_画板 1 副本 2.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Based on insights from previous interviews with users and Reasi product manager, I created a new card layout.
                    First of all, I redesigned the information architecture of the card, according to users, the first thing they want to know
                    when they visit dashboard is which are lands they are selling and which are they are buying, then they want to know what's the listing progress.
                </br>
                    I have decided to use two different colors to represent the role of buyer and seller.
                </p>
                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/interation1_画板 1 副本 3.png">
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- It would be more distinguishable if users can add photos of the lands since images are much easier to remember.
                    </br>- The difference between each IA level is not clear.
                </p>

                </br>
                </br>
                </br>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 2:</b>
                    </br> 
                    Before moving onto the next iteration, we showed our design to 3 target users and received positive feedback on the new layout.
                    In the meantime, our users also suggested we can emphasize a little bit more on the selling price since, in the transaction, the price might vary from time to time, it is also important to see the latest price when they open the app.
                
                </br> 
                </br> 
                    So I made several changes in this round: 
                    </br> 1. Users can upload photos when creating listings and they will be shown on the dashboard.
                    </br> 2. Put more emphasis on the selling price which should be as important as the listing name.

                <p>

                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/interation2_画板 1 副本 4.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- There are many elements on the listing card that help users distinguish between different listings, so it is more important now to keep the color consistent across different cards and keep the minimal difference to guide new users.
                    </br>- Try to reduce the size of those two buttons for users to access more easily when they are on the field trip.

                </p>

                </br>
                </br>
                </br>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 3:</b>
                    </br> 
                    I presented my design to my managers and we ran a second round of testings with our users. Here are my findings:
                </br> 1. Users still need the "Share" function even they already have a buyer for a property.
                </br> 2. Move the two buttons to right/left would be easier for them to tap those two buttons.
                </br> 2. Users want to know what tasks they need to complete on the dashboard
                </br> 
                Based on the insights, I created the final listing card design:
                <p>

                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/interation3_画板 1 副本 5.png">

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- Users can manage different transactions more effectively.
                    </br>- The UI looks more consistent.

                </p>

                    </br>The original workspace mainly consists of five sections. To get a better andsystematic understanding of this feature, I visualized the information architecture by drawing this diagram below, then I figured out the five sections can be integrated and simplified into two parts:
                </br>
                <b>1.Escrow Information and 2.Escrow Tasks.</b>

                    It is intimidating to step into a whole new world like the real estate industry and try to fix problems for experts in that area.
                    I did spend a fair amount of time on understanding how does the real estate transaction work in the U.S., who are the stakeholders, and even real estate terms.
                    But those efforts paid off when I started to work on the design part. I can put myself in users' shoes and be confident about my ideas because I know every single step in the 
                    whole complicated progress and when I took a closer look at each of them, the perplexing process will be broken down into multiple smaller pieces and the problem is easier to solve.

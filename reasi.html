                    <P> The U.S. real estate market was totally an unfamiliar territory to me. In the kick-off meeting with our client Reasi,
                        I was confused because I didn't know anything about the workflow, who the stakeholders are, and even the professional terms they were using.
                        But I was also passionate and confident because I knew I can get familiar with this area quickly because I love to step into a new area, get to know target users with empathizing methods, and provide design solutions.
                        After conducting research methods like User Interview, User Journey Map, User Workflow diagram, etc, I crafted a new mobile app design with a focus on redesigning the <span class= 'inline-style'>

                        completing transaction-related tasks and enhanced user engagement by 64%.

                    How does the current system help users complete their tasks and is there any usability issue?
                </span>
                <p> 
                    I conducted a user flow analysis of the current Reasi website by creating an interaction map, and at the same time, I
                    also reviewed every interface and compared it against accepted usability principles by using heuristic evaluations.
                    My goals are trying to quickly get a solid understanding of Reasi product and see where things could be improved potentially.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Key Findings:</span>
                    </br>1. The user flow can be divided into three parts: Onboarding process, Create a listing & share, and workspace.
                    </br>2. The listing creation process seems overwhelming.
                    </br>3. The Workspace feature requires users to complete many tasks but there is a lack of guidance.
                    </br>4. Dashboard needs more indicators(colors, pictures, icons) to show different roles and status.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>
                    Also, I knew that the workspace is the most important feature of Reasi which digitizes
                    the transaction between land buyers and sellers,

                <p> To validate my findings from the previous step and gather more insights from current Reasi users and the product owner
                    I interviewed one Reasi employee and 4 current users.</p>

                    <span>Key Findings:</span>
                    </br>1. Reasi users are land investors who represent both sellers and buyers.
                    </br>2. The dashboard should be more distinguishable in terms of showing different rols(seller, buyer), and transaction progress.
                    </br>3. After opening escrow, users would only hear from the escrow company when escrow company needs them to sign documents.
                    Normally they have to wait for more than one month and there is no status update during the process.

                <span>User Journey Map</span>
                <p>
                    During interviews with stakeholders, I found myself easily get confused with 
                    the transaction process because there are too many steps and three types of stakeholders(buyer, seller, and the escrow company).
                    To get a clear picture of the whole process and also explore potential insights in each stage, I built the user journey map to 
                    visualize the process as well as stakeholders' tasks.
                </p>
                <div class="inside_img">

                    <span>Key Findings:</span>   
                    </br>1. The In Escrow stage which is also when users engage with the Workspace feature is the most challenging and frustrating stage.
                    </br>2. There is a lack of a convenient way for users to communicate with the escrow company during the in escrow prcoss.                    
            </div>


            <div class = 'persona align-left'>
                <span>In-Escorw Workflow</span>
                <p>
                   As the In Escrow process consists of multiple tasks, it is complicated and fragmented. 
                   Although I created the User Journey Map, there are still some confusions:
                </br>1. Do those tasks have to be done sequentially?
                </br>2. How do those tasks connect?
                </br>3. How do sellers, buyers, and Reasi communicate with each other in the process and or do they need to?
                </br>
                   So I decided to map all of the steps and created a workflow diagram not only take a closer look at the in escrow process but also 
                   explore how might we improve the workspace feature to help users complete tasks more efficiently.

                <p>After previous research, I presented my findings to my ZLI manager and the product manager of Reasi. 
                    We ran a brainstorming session to come up with new solution ideas, then we used the Impact/Effort matrix to evaluate our ideas.<p>

                    As a result, we decided to focus on 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10.
                    <br>
                    In the following paragraphs, I will focus on the redesign of the <b>Dashboard</b> and the <b>Workspace</b> features.

                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>OVERVIEW</b> 
                    </br>The whole design process includes three iterations. I started from the original version of the dashboard. Since previous research told us that Reasi users who are land investors play both the seller and the buyer role at the same time, I kept the original design that users can check lands they are selling and buying on the same page. 
                    And I adopted many strategies here to help users distinguish each listing and manage listings effectively, which includes changing the layout of the card, adding property photos, and also using orange color to represent the role of buyer, and light blue color to represent the role of the seller.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    For each iteration, I presented my design to ZLI manager and Reasi product manager to get feedback and for the 2nd and 3rd round of iteration, we conducted usability testing to get feedback from users.

                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 1:</b> 
                    </br>To start with, I took a look at the information architecture of the card and 
                    see if the hierarchy that the card is surfacing to users is what they need to see the most.
                    And also I wanted to know if the listing card is providing enough or digestible amount of information to the user.
                <p>
                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/original-IA_画板 1 副本 2.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Based on insights from previous interviews with users and Reasi product manager, I created a new card layout.
                    First of all, I redesigned the information architecture of the card, according to users, the first thing they want to know
                    when they visit dashboard is which are lands they are selling and which are they are buying, then they want to know what's the listing progress.
                </br>
                    I have decided to use two different colors to represent the role of buyer and seller.
                </p>
                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/interation1_画板 1 副本 3.png">
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- It would be more distinguishable if users can add photos of the lands since images are much easier to remember.
                    </br>- The differences between each IA levels are not significant.
                </p>

                </br>
                </br>
                </br>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 2:</b>
                    </br> 
                    Before moving onto the next iteration, we showed our design to 3 target users and received positive feedback on the new layout.
                    In the meantime, our users also suggested us to emphasize a little bit more on the selling price since, in the transaction, the price might vary from time to time.
                    It would be helpful if they can check the latest price when they open the app.
                
                </br> 
                </br> 
                    So I made several changes in this round: 
                    </br> 1. Users can upload photos when creating listings.
                    </br> 2. Put more emphasis on the selling price which should be as important as the listing name in terms of information architecture.

                <p>

                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/interation2_画板 1 副本 4.png">

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- There are many elements on the listing card that help users distinguish between different listings, so it is more important now to keep the color consistent across different cards and keep the minimal difference to guide new users.
                    </br>- Try to reduce the size of those two buttons for users to access more easily when they are on the field trip.

                </p>

                </br>
                </br>
                </br>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 3:</b>
                    </br> 
                    I presented my design to my managers and we ran a second round of testings with our users. Here are my findings:
                </br> 1. Users still need the "Share" function even they already have a buyer for a property.
                </br> 2. Move the two buttons to right/left would be easier for them to tap those two buttons.
                </br> 2. Users want to know what tasks they need to complete on the dashboard
                </br> 
                Based on the insights, I created the final listing card design:
                <p>

                <div class="inside_img">

                    </br>- Users can manage different transactions more effectively.
                    </br>- The UI looks more consistent.

                </p>

            <div class = 'userflow align-left'>

                <span>Workspace Redesign</span>

                <p>
                <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>OVERVIEW</b> 
                </br>The workspace feature is for sellers and buyers to complete all required closing tasks after buyers accept the offer and they open escrow.
                The original workspace feature showed every piece of information on the same page which ends up being super long. Based on previous research and 3 iterations,
                I turned it into a task-centered system that prioritizes tasks that are waiting for actions and also added a new feature for users to communicate with the Reasi facilitator efficiently and simply. 
                </p>

                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/workspace-overall_画板 1 副本 10.png">

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>ITERATION 1:</b> 
                    </br>The original workspace mainly consists of five sections. To get a better understanding of the current solution, I visualized the information architecture by drawing this diagram below, then I figured out the five sections can be integrated and simplified into two parts:
                    </br>
                    <b>1.Transaction Information 
                    </br>
                        2.Transaction Tasks.</b>
                </p>
                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/reasi/workspace_画板 1 副本 4.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    So I decided to split the Workspace feature up into two sections: the task section and the information section.
                    </br>
                    In the meantime, based on the insights from previous research, I turned the task section into a task list with a 
                    progress bar to help users be aware of tasks in the future. I also added the Message feature for users to request 
                    transaction status updates. To begin with, I used sketches to present my idea to ZLI and Reasi manager to get feedback quickly.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- It would require too much effort to develop a whole new messaging section just for users requesting updates, and also
                    Reasi was hoping to automate the escrow process in the future so a messaging system would increase the operating costs.
                    </br>- Getting rid of the task progress bar because it is repetitive and unnecessary since it is shown on the dashboard.

                    </br>
                    For this round of iteration, I got rid of the messaging feature and the task progress bar based on previous feedback. 
                    Instead, I created a new model for users to request for updates: users can let the Reasi facilitator know that they want an update by
                    clicking the "Request for Update " button, and then the Reasi facilitator would receive this request and respond to it by leaving a note to users.

                    To get feedback from real users on the new feature and the new layout, I conducted usability testings 
                    with 3 real Reasi users.

                    <b style = 'font-size:1.3rem'>FEEDBACK:</b> 
                    </br>- I noticed that users rarely access the About section to check the basic information of the listing. 
                    They mentioned that normally the basic information would be confirmed before they enter the escrow process and they wouldn't refer to it frequently.
                    </br>- The Task section should emphasize unfinished tasks instead of putting completed tasks above unfinished tasks.
                    </br>- The  "Request for Update" feature is intuitive and simple, and also offers users an option to communicate with Reasi without spending too much effort.

                    Based on insights from previous testing, I moved the whole information section onto another page which users can access by clicking the text "More Info" on the original page, which not only 
                    made the first page look simple and emphasize on the tasks, but also helped users store those information in case they need to see it.
                    Also, I split the Task section up into two parts: To-do's and Completed tasks to help users emphasize on tasks that they need to do.

                    It is intimidating to step into a whole new world like the real estate industry and try to fix problems for experts in that area.
                    I did spend a fair amount of time on understanding how does the real estate transaction work in the U.S., who are the stakeholders, and even real estate terms.
                    But those efforts paid off when I started to work on the design part. I can put myself in users' shoes and be confident about my ideas because I know every single step in the 
                    whole complicated progress and when I took a closer look at each of them, the perplexing process will be broken down into multiple smaller pieces and the problem is easier to solve.

                        The giving feature on the Life Church app is where people begin their generosity journey and grow their relationship with God. It is very important for Life Church because 90% of the gifts that Life Church receives every year come from it.

                        <br>
                        I  have been working as the Design Lead on the giving feature since August 2021, and my goal has always been to provide a frictionless giving experience for people who feel a passion to trust God financially!

                            The new giving experience has increased giving conversion rate by 15.2% on iOS.

                            In the year of 2022, Life Church's giving increased by 4% compared to the previous year. This growth is significant considering that Life Church initially predicted a decrease of 3% due to the prevailing economic situation.                        </span>

                    I started my research with the question: "What is the current behavior pattern of givers, and what insights can we gather from this pattern regarding the pain points our givers are facing?"

                        To reduce the cognitive burden of completing the giving form, the information hierarchy was reorganized. Relevant selectors were combined and brought closer together, while less important selectors were deemphasized.                    </span>
